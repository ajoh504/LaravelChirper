# LaravelChirper

LaravelChirper is a Twitter-like project built through the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com). The purpose of this project is to serve as a sandbox for PHP and the Laravel framework.

### Features

Some of the key features include user authentication, user profile management, and the ability to create new posts, or "Chirps". 

The project also incorporates a "follow" system, allowing users to follow other users, as well as a "feed" system to display recent Chirps.

### Sandbox

This project delves into various development topics, including:

- Setting up Laravel database migrations
- Utilizing Controllers to handle HTTP requests and responses
- Interfacing with the database through Models

Additional dependencies include React for the views, Laravel Breeze for the web server, and Vite for hot-module replacement.
